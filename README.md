Employee Database Management System in Java

This project implements a simple Employee Database Management System in Java. It allows you to:
* Add Employee Details: Enter details like name, job position, contact number, employee ID, salary, hire date, and address for multiple employees.
* Sort by Salary (Descending): Arrange employee records based on their salary in descending order.
* Search by Job Position: Find and display employee information based on their job title.
* Search by Hire Date Range: Retrieve employee details for those hired within a specific date range.
* Search by Salary Range: View employee information for those with salaries falling within a specified range.
* Count Foreign Employees: Determine the number of employees whose contact number doesn't start with the country code "+91" (assuming it represents the target country).

  
Usage
1. Save the code as a Java file (e.g., EmployeeDatabase.java).
2. Compile and run the program using a Java compiler and runtime environment.
3. The program will prompt you to enter the number of employees to add.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to enter details for each employee.
5. After entering all employee data, the program will present a menu with various options for sorting, searching, and displaying information.
6. Select the desired option by entering the corresponding number and follow any further prompts.


Dependencies
This program requires a Java compiler and runtime environment (JDK) to be installed on your system.

Note
Currently, the program stores employee data in memory only. Once you exit the program, all information will be lost.
This is a basic example showcasing functionalities like data storage, sorting, searching, and filtering. It can be further extended to include features like data persistence (saving to a file or database), adding/deleting employees, and modifying existing records
